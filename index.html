       <p>This movie literally had the perfect balance of humor and seriousness as everyone toned back the cheesy humor at the right moment to keep the story going.

        Another thing I appreciate is seeing the pure friendship that Sonic, Tails, & Knuckles develop. Nothing seems awkward or weird, but rather pure innocent childlike friendship chemistry that you experienced as a kid and shines brightly in the darker world that they’re in.
        
        I also want to emphasize how well Jim Carry did, because we know how over the top he is with his humor but with Eggman it just fits so well. He laughs and mocks when he has the upper hand just like Eggman. He’s selfish and is truly obsessed with power. Once he has the chaos emerald, he matures while still maintaining his goofy character slightly which I think was phenomenal. Too serious would have taken the charm out, and if he was too goofy, it wouldn’t have carried the tension that was there. Just more mature than he was when we first meet him. He’s entirely focused on power and will stop at nothing to get it. The way he even mocks Knuckles was hilarious & freaking sad haha due to Knuckles’ nativity which any Sonic fan can remember experiencing. 
        
        We also have just how laid back Sonic is. Again, some people may think it’s cheesy which I would agree if this was any new super hero movie. The hero being this super laxed character who isn’t worried about anything and always sees the good, that is cheesy and generic. But why it’s different is because that’s who we grew up with. Sonic was always fearless and never took Eggman that serious. He also was a true friend to Tails and never wanted to fight Knuckes.
